Regex Data Extraction - Group 4
This project is part of the Regex Onboarding Hackathon. Our group, Group 4, created a Python web app that uses Regular Expressions to find specific data from large text files. The app can search and extract different types of information automatically, such as emails, phone numbers, URLs, and more.
We made this project to show how regex can be used to handle real-world tasks like data extraction. By creating regex patterns, we can find and extract important data from messy text without needing to do it manually.

Data Types Extracted
Our project focuses on these data types:

Email addresses – Finds emails in the text.
URLs – Extracts web addresses.
Phone numbers – Recognizes numbers in different formats.
Credit card numbers – Detects common credit card number formats.
Time formats – Extracts times in 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
HTML tags – Finds basic HTML tags in the text.
Hashtags – Identifies hashtags from social media.
Currency amounts – Detects money amounts with or without commas.

Conclusion
Our project shows how useful regex can be for data extraction. By using Python and working as a team, we were able to create a tool that automatically pulls out important data from large amounts of text.
